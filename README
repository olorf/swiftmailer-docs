Swift Mailer Documentation
--------------------------

This repository contains DITA source files for the Swift Mailer
Documentation.

In order to do anything with this source you will need a copy
of DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) which is available free online:

http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/

You also need Java JDK 1.4.2 or higher and Ant 1.5 or higher.

Once you have an extracted copy of the toolkit somewhere on disk,
you need to open a command line window (such as Terminal.app on
Mac OS X or cmd.exe on Windows) and set an environment variable
mapping $DITA_DIR to the path where you extracted DITA-OT.

If you have the correct $DITA_DIR in your environment, you should
be able to build the documentation as XHTML or as PDF by running
Ant.

  -$  cd swiftmailer-docs
  -$  ant -f ant_scripts/build.xml dita2xhtml

You may substitute "dita2xhtml" with "dita2pdf" in the above command
if you want a PDF copy.

The output files will be placed in the "output/" directory.
