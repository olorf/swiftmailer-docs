    <p>
      If you post a bug or request a feature in the forum, or on the Google Group you will most
      likely be asked to create a ticket in Lighthouse since it is the simply not feasible to
      manage such requests from a number of a different sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following link is for the Lighthouse project page:
      <xref href="http://swiftmailer.lighthouseapp.com/" format="html" />
    </p>
    
    <image href="images/docs/lighthouse.png" placement="break" />
    
    <p>
      When you go to Lighthouse you will be asked to create a username and password before you can
      create a ticket.  This is free and takes very little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create your ticket, do not assign it to any milestones.  A developer will assess your
      ticket and re-assign it as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your ticket is reporting a bug present in the current version, which was not present in the
      previous version please include the tag "regression" in your ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighthouse will update you when work is performed on your ticket.
