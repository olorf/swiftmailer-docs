    <p>
      The book begins with an overview of Swift Mailer, discussing what's included
      in the package and preparing you for the remainder of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to read this user guide just like any other book (from beginning
      to end). Each chapter begins with a discussion of the contents it contains, followed
      by a short code sample designed to give you a head start.  As you get further
      into a chapter you will learn more about Swift Mailer's capabilities, but often
      you will be able to head directly to the topic you wish to learn about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this book you will be presented with code samples, which
      most people should find ample to implement Swift Mailer appropriately in their
      own projects.  I will also use diagrams where appropriate, and where I believe
      readers may find it helpful I will discuss some related theory, including reference
      to certain documents you are able to find online.
