  <title>Code Samples</title>
  <shortdesc>
    Code samples presented in this book will be displayed on a different colored background
    in a monospaced font.  Samples are not to be taken as copy &amp; paste code snippets.

    <p>
      Code examples are used through the book to clarify what is written in text.  They will
      sometimes be usable as-is, but they should always be taken as outline/pseudo code only.
    </p>
    <p>
      A code sample will look like this:
    </p>
    <codeblock  outputclass="kodify php"><![CDATA[
class AClass
{
  ...
}

//A Comment
$obj = new AClass($arg1, $arg2, ... );

/* A note about another way of doing something
$obj = AClass::newInstance($arg1, $arg2, ... );

*/
]]></codeblock>
    <p>
      The presence of 3 dots <codeph>...</codeph> in a code sample indicates that I have left out a chunk
      of the code for brevity, they are not actually part of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will often place multi-line comments <codeph>/* ... */</codeph> in the code so that
      I can show alternative ways of achieving the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should read the code examples given and try to understand them.  They are kept concise
      so that you are not overwhelmed with information.
    </p>
