      In this chapter we will take a short tour of the various components, which put together
      form the Swift Mailer library as a whole.  You will learn key terminology used throughout
      the rest of this book and you will gain a little understanding of the classes you will work
      with as you integrate Swift Mailer into your application.

      This chapter is intended to prepare you for the information contained in the subsequent
      chapters of this book.  You may choose to skip this chapter if you are fairly technically
      minded, though it is likely to save you some time in the long run if you at least read
      between the lines here.
