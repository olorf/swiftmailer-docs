      <p>
        The Sendmail Transport, <codeph>Swift_SendmailTransport</codeph> does not directly connect to
        any remote services.  It is designed for Linux servers that have <cmdname>sendmail</cmdname>
        installed.  The Transport starts a local <cmdname>sendmail</cmdname> process and sends messages
        to it.  Usually the <cmdname>sendmail</cmdname> process will respond quickly as it spools your
        messages to disk before sending them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Transport is named the Sendmail Transport for historical reasons (<cmdname>sendmail</cmdname>
        was the "standard" UNIX tool for sending e-mail for years).  It will send
        messages using other transfer agents such as Exim or Postfix despite its name, provided
        they have the relevant sendmail wrappers so that they can be started with the
        correct command-line flags.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a common misconception that because the Sendmail Transport returns a result
        very quickly it must therefore deliver messages to recipients quickly &#8211; this
        is not true.  It's not slow by any means, but it's certainly not faster than SMTP
        when it comes to getting messages to the intended recipients.  This is because
        sendmail itself sends the messages over SMTP once they have been quickly spooled
        to disk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sendmail Transport has the potential to be just as smart of the SMTP Transport
        when it comes to notifying Swift Mailer about which recipients were rejected, but
        in reality the majority of locally installed <cmdname>sendmail</cmdname> instances are not configured
        well enough to provide any useful feedback.  As such Swift Mailer may report
        successful deliveries where they did in fact fail before they even left your server.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can run the Sendmail Transport in two different modes specified by command line flags:
        <ol>
          <li>"<cmdname>-bs</cmdname>" runs in SMTP mode so theoretically it will act like the SMTP Transport</li>
          <li>"<cmdname>-t</cmdname>" runs in piped mode with no feedback, but theoretically faster, though not advised</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of the Sendmail Transport as a sort of asynchronous SMTP Transport &#8211;
        though if you have problems with delivery failures you should try using the
        SMTP Transport instead.  Swift Mailer isn't doing the work here, it's simply passing
        the work to somebody else (i.e. <cmdname>sendmail</cmdname>).
