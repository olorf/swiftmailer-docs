  <title>Embedding Inline Media Files</title>
  <shortdesc>
    Often people want to include an image or other content inline with a HTML message.  It's easy to
    do this with HTML linking to remote resources, but this approach is usually blocked by mail
    clients.  Swift Mailer allows you to embed your media directly into the message.

      Mail clients usually block downloads from remote resources because this technique was often
      abused as a mean of tracking who opened an email.  If you're sending a HTML email and you
      want to include an image in the message another approach you can take is to embed the image
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift Mailer makes embedding files into messages extremely streamlined.  You embed a file
      by calling the <codeph>embed()</codeph> method of the message, which returns a value you
      can use in a <codeph>src</codeph> or <codeph>href</codeph> attribute in your HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like with attachments, it's possible to embed dynamically generated content without
      having an existing file available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embedded files are sent in the email as a special type of attachment that has a unique
      ID used to reference them within your HTML attributes.  On mail clients that do not support
      embedded files they may appear as attachments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this is commonly done for images, in theory it will work for any
      displayable (or playable) media type.  Support for other media types (such
      as video) is dependent on the mail client however.
