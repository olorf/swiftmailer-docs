    <p>
      This book has been written so that those who need information quickly are able
      to find what they need, and those who wish to learn more advanced topics can
      read around the related topics in this book.  The book begins with an overview
      of Swift Mailer, discussing what it's for and what it's not for, along with
      a few notes of interest.  The book then progresses into more detail, gaining
      complexity towards the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each chapter begins with a discussion of the contents it contains, followed
      by a short code example, followed by an in-depth breakdown of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this book you will be presented with a lot of code samples, which
      most people should find ample to implement Swift Mailer appropriately in their
      own projects.  I will also use diagrams where appropriate, and where I believe
      readers may find it helpful I will discuss some related theory, including reference
      to certain documents you are able to find online.
