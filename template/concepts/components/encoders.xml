  <title>Encoders</title>
  <shortdesc>
    Encoders are used to transform the content of Messages generated in Swift Mailer
    into a format that is safe to send across the internet and that conforms to RFC
    specifications.

      <p>
        Generally speaking you will not need to interact with the Encoders in Swift Mailer &#8211;
        the correct settings will be handled by the library itself.  However they are probably worth
        a brief mention in the event that you do want to play with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the Headers and the body of all MIME entities (including the Message itself) use Encoders
        to ensure the data they contain can be sent over the internet without becoming corrupted or
        misinterpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two types of Encoder: Base64 and Quoted-Printable.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="base64">
      <title>The Base64 Encoding Scheme</title>
      <p>
        Base64 encoding is provided by the <codeph>Swift_Encoder_Base64Encoder</codeph> class which is
        subclassed to produce slightly more targeted encoders for the Headers and the body respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entities that use the Base64 encoding scheme are those which contain binary data &#8211;
        specifically attachment data contained in a <codeph>Swift_Attachment</codeph> or a
        <codeph>Swift_EmbeddedFile</codeph>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the functionality exists, by default Headers do not make use of Base64 encoding
        because it is not intended for text content and obfuscates text to the extent it would
        not be understood by a human if the message is received corrupt and the Headers become visible.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="quoted-printable">
      <title>The Quoted-Printable Encoding Scheme</title>
      <p>
        Quoted-Printable (or QP for short) encoding is provided by the <codeph>Swift_Encoder_QpEncoder</codeph>
        class which is subclassed to produce slightly more targeted encoders for the Headers and the body respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entities that use the QP encoding scheme are those which contain text data, such as the Message itself
        and MIME parts attached to the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        QP encoding is only used if characters outside of the US-ASCII (standard US Keyboard) range
        are found in the text.  It is considered "mostly" readable by humans since almost
        all ASCII characters are left in their unencoded form.
      </p>
      <p>
        QP encoding may be used in the Headers of a MIME entity (such as in the Subject line of a Message)
        if non-ASCII characters are found in the text.
