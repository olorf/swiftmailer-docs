      <title>About the Load-Balanced Transport</title>
      <p>
        The Load-Balanced Transport, <codeph>Swift_LoadBalancedTransport</codeph> does not actually send
        Messages itself.  It is used in conjunction with any of the other Transports
        so that a large batch of messages can be distributed to a number of remote
        servers (and perhaps a local one).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not likely that the average Swift Mailer user will find a need for this
        Transport, but companies that need to send large volumes of mail and have
        access to several SMTP servers may opt to make use of this Transport so that
        the stress imposed on a single SMTP server is kept down (and theoretically
        mail will be sent faster &#8211; though it does not parallel process &#8211; yet!).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the scenario that excessive amounts of mail are being sent it is possible (likely
        in fact) that an SMTP server will fail to respond at some point during sending due to
        the stress it is under.  The Load-Balanced Transport tracks failures and skips
        dead-transports once it detects that they are no longer responding.
